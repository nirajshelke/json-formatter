The `lightning-toast-container` component manages a list of toast components and its order. Currently, a single page-level toast container is supported.

The component uses `LightningToast` as the toast component to display messages.

Set the maximum of toasts shown at a time with the `maxToasts` attribute, set the position of the component relative to its container component with `containerPosition` attribute and set the toasts position with `toastPosition` attribute.

The following example will create a toast container component. This component will handle and display all the page-level toast messages. Only 1 page-level container exists at a time.

By default, the toast container shows, at most, 3 toast notifications at the same time.  The most recent toast will display visually at the top or first, and the oldest toast notification will be displayed at the bottom of the toast container, or last. The container position is fixed to the viewport and the toast component will display at the top and center of the container.

```javascript
const toastContainer = ToastContainer.instance();
```

### Component attributes

The `maxToasts` attribute sets the maximum number of toasts shown in the container. It accepts any non-zero positive number. Default value is 3.

The `containerPosition` attribute changes the container position. It supports these values.

| Value | Explanation  |
|-------| ------------ |
| `fixed` (default) |  positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport |
| `absolute` | positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor |

The `toastPosition` attribute sets the toast components position in the container.

| Value | Explanation  |
|-------| ------------ |
| `top-center` (default) | toasts shown at top-center in the container |
| `top-left` | toasts shown at top-left in the container |
| `top-right` | toasts shown at top-right in the container |
| `bottom-center` | toasts shown at bottom-center in the container |
| `bottom-left` | toasts shown at bottom-left in the container |
| `bottom-right` | toasts shown at bottom-right in the container |

The following example changes the page-level toast container to show at most 5 toast messages at one time at the top-right in the viewport (i.e. `containerPosition` is `fixed` by default).
```javascript
// c/myApp.js
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';
import ToastContainer from 'lightning/toastContainer';

export default class MyApp extends LightningElement {
    connectedCallback() {
        const toastContainer = ToastContainer.instance();
        toastContainer.maxShown = 5;
        toastContainer.toastPosition = 'top-right';
    }
}
```

### Keyboard accessibility
Toast container is part of the [global focus orchestration](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/accessibility/guidelines/global-focus/#global-orchestration) which allows users to use the keyboard shortcut to navigate between toasts:
- Press `Command` + `F6` for Mac OS or `Control` + `F6` for others to move focus to next toast, if any
- Press `Shift` + `Command` + `F6` for Mac OS or `Shift` +`Control` + `F6` for others to move focus to the previous toast, if any.


### Future support (244+)
- Local toast container support - allows multiple toast containers in a page. A component can have its own toast container to display toast messages relevant to the component's context.
